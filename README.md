This project was made my me in the first year of my engineering. so w made this project because â€” In the past few decades many studies and researches have taken place in order to improve security systems and to increase their level of protection in different fields. One of the major problems that security must deal with is the fire outbreak that can happen in everywhere including houses , schools , factories and many other places, and to avoid that or to minimize the damage caused by fire outbreak an IOT technology is used to control such a kind of risk. IoT is a modern system that consist of sensors and switches connected to a central hub which called (gate way. In this project we will use temperature sensor known as (Flame sensor) with Arduino device to detect fire outbreak and to measure the amount of heat intensity generated by a fire outbreak or in a specific location in our house, offices and other places. It sometimes take to much time for the fire station to reach to the fire outbreak location and works on extinguish the fire and so these sensors will work as an early alarm system which will send an email notification to our mobile phones, fire stations and hospitals if any fire outbreak occurred to let us know the situation clearly and before its too late, we act to avoid significant damage in case the fire outbreak was observed after a long time from its outbreak.

The components which we have use are -:
Components Name	Quantity
Arduino Uno	1
MQ-135 Gas Sensor	1
Flame sensor	1
Green LED	2
Red LED	1
Buzzer	1


I have added a C++ file which is the code for this oroject you just have to run that code in you arduino ID software and run on the arduino uno board which all the connetion. To see how to do connection of all the componets refer to the report and the ppt which i have also given with the code.
